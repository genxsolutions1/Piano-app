# Piano App - Major UI and Functionality Improvements

## üéâ All Issues Fixed!

### 1. ‚úÖ Sound Playback - FIXED!

**Problem:** No sound when pressing piano keys.

**Solution:** 
- Completely rewrote `SoundEngine.kt` to use **AudioTrack** instead of SoundPool
- Implemented real-time audio synthesis using sine waves with piano-like envelope
- Each key now generates a proper tone at the correct frequency (MIDI note to Hz conversion)
- Added exponential decay envelope for realistic piano attack/decay
- Audio plays immediately when keys are pressed with low latency

**Technical Details:**
- Uses AudioTrack with MODE_STATIC for pre-generated waveforms
- 44.1 kHz sample rate, 16-bit PCM
- Frequency calculation: 440Hz * 2^((note-69)/12)
- 2-second tone duration with exponential decay envelope
- Amplitude scaled by velocity (0-127)

**Result:** Piano keys now produce audible, musical tones when pressed! üéµ

### 2. ‚úÖ Recording Flow - FIXED!

**Problem:** Recording and stop actions were confusing - unclear workflow.

**Solution:**
- Simplified to a **single-button workflow**:
  - **"START RECORDING"** button when idle
  - **"STOP & SAVE"** button when recording
- When user clicks **STOP**, the save dialog **automatically appears**
- Removed the separate "Save" button to streamline the process
- Added clear visual feedback:
  - Blinking red recording indicator during recording
  - "RECORDING IN PROGRESS..." text
  - Changed button colors (Red for record, Blue for stop)

**Workflow Now:**
1. Click "START RECORDING" ‚Üí Recording begins
2. Play piano keys ‚Üí Events are captured
3. Click "STOP & SAVE" ‚Üí Recording stops AND save dialog appears immediately
4. Enter filename ‚Üí Recording is saved automatically

**Result:** Crystal clear recording process - no confusion! üìπ

### 3. ‚úÖ Piano UI - COMPLETELY REDESIGNED!

**Problem:** Piano buttons didn't look like a real piano.

**Solution:** Complete visual overhaul to look like a classic grand piano:

#### White Keys:
- Ivory white color (#FAFAFA)
- Realistic shadows (6dp elevation)
- Rounded bottom corners (8dp radius)
- Dark borders (2dp, #1A1A1A)
- Press effect: lighter color + reduced shadow
- Proper spacing between keys

#### Black Keys:
- Deep black color (#1A1A1A)
- Positioned correctly over white keys
- 60% height of white keys (170dp vs 280dp)
- Enhanced shadows (8dp elevation)
- Glossy appearance with subtle borders
- Proper width (65% of white key width)

#### Keyboard Background:
- Dark wood-like background (#2C2C2C)
- 8dp padding around keys
- 280dp total height for proper proportions

#### Layout Improvements:
- Used zIndex to properly layer black keys over white keys
- Precise positioning of black keys (C#/F# at 0.75, D#/G#/A# at 0.7)
- No gaps or overlaps
- Maintains aspect ratio on different screen sizes

**Result:** Looks like a real piano! üéπ
